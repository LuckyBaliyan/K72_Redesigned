## K72 Rebuild

## 📖 About the Project

K72 Rebuild is a personal learning and open-source recreation of the K72 website — a design that immediately caught my attention for its stunning page transitions, dynamic effects, and immersive visuals.

The goal of this project was to understand, recreate, and enhance the motion design and interactivity that made the original site stand out.
It’s a front-end-focused project built to explore modern web animations, parallax effects, and smooth scrolling experiences.
## 🚀 Features  

- ⚡ Smooth Scrolling: Implemented using Locomotive Scroll for a fluid and natural navigation experience.

- 🎞️ Page Transitions: Crafted smooth and elegant transitions between different sections and pages.

- 🎨 Custom Effects: Added subtle motion effects that elevate the overall user experience.

- 📁 Modular Code Structure: Organized React components for scalability and maintainability.

- 🧠 Learning-Focused: Built from scratch to strengthen my understanding of animation libraries, React hooks, and scroll behavior.
